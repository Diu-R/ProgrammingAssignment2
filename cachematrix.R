## The following two functions work together to calculate the inverse of a matrix
## quickly by caching the result. It ensures that the inverse is 
## calculated only once (unless the matrix changes) which reduces computational time. 

## The first function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## It returns a list containing functions to set and get the matrix and its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinv <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getinv()
  if (!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(inv)
  inv
}
